# Customer_List

The challenge consists in creating an android app that perform
a CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations. The app should consume a mock API or can use a real API also.

Technical requirements:
- Use kotlin
- Consume the API (mock or not)
- Validate the inputs

Workflow:
- Keep the code in GitHub
- Small commits should be made so the team can check the code in small pieces instead of the whole thing at once

Requirements:
- The application must handle errors (crashes due to errors mishandling not welcome haha)
- Forms input must be validated upon submit (on changes is a plus)
- At least one remote service must be queried for data
